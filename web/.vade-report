# Vercel Web Analytics Implementation

Successfully implemented Vercel Web Analytics for the Next.js App Router project.

## Changes Made

### 1. Package Installation
- Installed `@vercel/analytics` version 1.6.1 using pnpm
- Updated `package.json` to include the new dependency
- Updated `pnpm-lock.yaml` with the new package and its dependencies (874 new packages added to the lockfile)

### 2. Modified Files

#### `src/app/layout.tsx`
- **Import Added**: Added `import { Analytics } from "@vercel/analytics/next";` at the top of the file
- **Component Added**: Inserted `<Analytics />` component inside the `<body>` tag, placed after the `<ThemeProvider>{children}</ThemeProvider>` component
- **Placement Rationale**: The Analytics component is positioned at the end of the body to ensure it doesn't block the rendering of the main content while still capturing all page views

### 3. Code Structure
The implementation follows Next.js App Router best practices:
- Analytics component is imported from the Next.js-specific package (`@vercel/analytics/next`)
- Component is placed in the root layout to track all pages in the application
- Existing code structure, imports, and styling are preserved
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

### 4. Verification
- ✅ Linter ran successfully with no errors introduced by our changes
- ✅ Package installation completed successfully
- ✅ TypeScript types are correctly resolved for the Analytics component
- ℹ️  Build requires environment variables (RECIPIENT_WALLET_ADDRESS) that are project-specific and unrelated to Analytics implementation

## Technical Details
- **Project Type**: Next.js 16.1.6 with App Router
- **Package Manager**: pnpm
- **Analytics Package Version**: @vercel/analytics@1.6.1
- **Integration Point**: Root layout file (`src/app/layout.tsx`)

## Notes
The Analytics component will automatically:
- Track page views across all routes
- Collect Web Vitals metrics
- Send data to Vercel Analytics when deployed
- Work in both development and production environments (with data only sent in production by default)

No additional configuration is required. The analytics will start working once the application is deployed to Vercel.
